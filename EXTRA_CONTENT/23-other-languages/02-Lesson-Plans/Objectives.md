# 23 - Learning Objectives

The learning objectives for this unit are as follows:

* Given a **target language**, students will be able to:

  * Install the language, if necessary.

  * Install the tools (IDE, build system, etc.) required to create and run programs in the language, if necessary.

  * Identify the conventional **entry point** for programs in the language.

  * Enumerate which essential structures they should familiarize themselves with first. 

    * In particular, given a build system or interpreter (as the language calls for), they should be able to:

      * Declare variables using built-in **primitives** and **data types**;

      * Manipulate and combine those data types using the built-in operators of the language;

      * Define and call functions;

      * Implement branching behavior using the basic conditional control structures of the language;

      * Implement iteration using basic looping structures;

      * Define and populate basic collection classes. Namely:

        * Arrays/lists

        * Basic maps.

      * Define and instantiate classes, where applicable;

      * Import functionality from modules/libraries/etc. external to the immediate file/project/etc.
